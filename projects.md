## Advanced Analysis of Null Pointer Dereference in Linux

 Investigated and resolved a null pointer dereference in Linux by analyzing and comparing static analysis tools (Cppcheck, Codechecker, Facebook Infer, SonarQube) against the Juliet Test Suite for cybersecurity enhancement. This process sharpened my expertise in static analysis and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.


## Driver Drowsiness Detection

Designed a vehicle safety system aimed at detecting driver drowsiness through real-time monitoring of facial and eye movements. This system calculates a drowsiness index to help prevent accidents, with the entire implementation carried out in Matlab. 

It utilizes Sobel Edge Detection for clearer edge delineation, the Viola-Jones Algorithm for accurate facial recognition, and K-Means Clustering for assessing the driver's alertness by analyzing the state of the eyes and mouth. This project demonstrates the significant impact of image processing algorithms on improving vehicle safety and preventing accidents caused by drowsiness.
