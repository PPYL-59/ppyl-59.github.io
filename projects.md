## Advanced Analysis of Null Pointer Dereference in Linux

 Investigated and resolved a null pointer dereference in Linux by analyzing and comparing static analysis tools (Cppcheck, Codechecker, Facebook Infer, SonarQube) against the Juliet Test Suite for cybersecurity enhancement. This process sharpened my expertise in static analysis and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.


## [Driver Drowsiness Detection] (https://github.com/krishna212/DrowsinessDetection.git)

Developed a vehicle safety system focusing on driver drowsiness detection. Using real-time facial and eye movement analysis, our system calculates a drowsiness index to preempt accidents, implemented in Matlab. It integrates Sobel Edge Detection for edge delineation, the Viola-Jones Algorithm for facial recognition, and K-Means Clustering to assess the driver's alertness by analyzing eye and mouth status. This project highlights the role of image processing algorithms in improving vehicle safety and preventing accidents due to drowsiness.
