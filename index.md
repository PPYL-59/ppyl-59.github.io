Software Engineer — Applied AI & Secure Cloud Systems

I’m Ajith Chowdary Nuthalapati, a software engineer working at the intersection of applied AI and secure, cloud-native systems. I earned my M.S. in Computer Engineering & Cybersecurity from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), and I’ve built software across startups, research/teaching, and industry.

I care about problems where reliability, privacy, and real-world usefulness, like event-driven architectures, observability, secure-by-default patterns, and privacy-aware learning at the edge. My approach is simple—frame the problem clearly, ship in small increments, write things down, and measure what matters. I’m always up for thoughtful collaborations that turn good ideas into trustworthy systems people actually use.



**Focus Areas**

**AI agents & orchestration** — Practical, human-in-the-loop systems that automate routine work

**Event-driven cloud** — Serverless backends and data/ML pipelines

**Reliability & observability** — Making systems diagnosable, testable, and easy to operate

**Security & privacy** — Secure-by-default patterns and privacy-preserving/edge learning

**Developer tooling** — Interfaces and workflows that speed up safe delivery
